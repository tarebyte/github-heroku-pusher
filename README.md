#Introduction
github-heroku-pusher does pretty much what sounds like it does. It takes a github repo, grabs the latest version and pushes it to heroku.

#Setup
In order for the pusher to run, we need to get these four variables:

*   HEROKU_USERNAME
*   HEROKU\_API_KEY (Found at the bottom of the [account page](https://api.heroku.com/account))
*   GITHUB_REPO (Example: https://github.com/ajlai/Test)
*   HEROKU_REPO (Example: git@heroku.com:smooth-sword-2980.git)

Next, we can set up the app in Heroku:

    git clone git://github.com/tarebyte/github-heroku-pusher.git
    cd github-heroku-pusher
    heroku create --stack cedar
    git push heroku master

Now, set up the variables from earlier under Heroku's [config vars](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars):

Finally, set up the [post-receive url](https://help.github.com/articles/post-receive-hooks) to point to YOUR_APP/post-receive (Example: http://severe-dusk-3039.herokuapp.com/post-receive)

Try pushing a commit to master on your github repo, and watch Heroku redeploy the code!

#TODO
*   Clean up this README
*   Get private repos working
*   Speed up cloning (git clone via http is slow as molasses, let's use git://)
*   Support for multiple repo monitoring
*   Test cases
